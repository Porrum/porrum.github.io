I'm Erik, a doctoral researcher at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security. My research focuses on the application of formal methods to the analysis of security protocols. You can read more about it [here](/research).

I am also a software engineer, taught at University of Augsburg, TU Munich and LMU Munich and trained at SAP. Before starting my PhD, I worked at IBM, where I developed identity and access management software and technology showcases. Take a look at my CV [here](/cv).
